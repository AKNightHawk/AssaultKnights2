Each .rar file is over 700mb. You will need this to work on AK
Also you will need to download the Patch for the game too.
Which you can get here.

You must put the files into the AssaultKnights3.2.085\Project\Bin folder. And overwrite everything.
There is a folder called Bin in the rar file. You must copy everything in that folder and drag and drop it
into the bin folder. Make sure it does not look like AssaultKnights3.2.085\Project\Bin\Bin
If you see a 2nd Bin folder inside the Bin folder. You messed up the patch.

It is best to go into the Bin folder in the .rar file and select everything. Then Drag and drop the dlls into 
the Bin folder in the Assault Knights Directory. Overwriting everything.

If you want to work on the source code for the game. Be sure to E-mail me directly first. at assaultknights@hotmail.com
before you try to add anything here. 

Thanks so much.

Night Hawk.
